# ViewVir

ViewVir is a simple pipeline created for visualization and analysis of viral metagenomes in RNAseq samples. The initial input to run the pipeline is the `nonHost_sequences` folder, which must contain the assembly of the RNAseq libraries of interest. ViewVir is based on Diamond Aligner analysis and uses interactive Plotly graphics to visualize results.
